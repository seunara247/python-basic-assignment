# PYTHON BASIC ASSIGNMENT

This assignment demonstrates my understanding of basic Python programming concepts such as variables, data types, conditional statements, and loops.

## Assignment Objectives

By completing this assignment, I learned how to:

- Declare and use variables in Python

- Identify and use basic data types

- Use if, elif, and else for decision making

- Use for and while loops for iteration

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Variables & Data Types

- Declared variables of types: `string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, and `list`

- Printed the value and type of each variable using `type()` function

### Task 2: User Input & Conditional Statements

- Took user input for age

- Used `if` and `else` to check if the user is eligible to vote (age 18 and above)

### Task 3: Loops

- Wrote a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10

- Wrote a `while` loop to print even numbers between 1 and 20

### Task 4: Mini Challenge

- Created a list of 5 fruits

- Used a `for` loop to print each fruit in **uppercase**

- Skipped the fruit `"banana"` using `continue`
